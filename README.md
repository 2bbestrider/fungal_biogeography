The fungal trait data can be found in the ```fungi_data/``` folder, along with the climate conditions for each location. The ```geo_data/``` folder contains ancillary files for fitting the geospatial models. The main code for reproducing the results can be found in the files *Summary_statistics.R* and *Regression_and_maps.R* in ```code/``` folder.
